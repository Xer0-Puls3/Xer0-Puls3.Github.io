# Puls3's Website
All of my things in one place, that's a lot of things!

## Credits
This entire site was written from the ground up starting with nothing but blank files. All of the images (minus one), the html, the CSS, and the JS, and everything else, was all created from scratch by [Puls3](https://github.com/xPuls3) for this website.

More recently I've started to use a single image that I did not create on my site;
<br>\- [*Stellar Collision* by KuldarLeement](https://www.deviantart.com/kuldarleement/art/Stellar-collision-397866757)

I've credited his work as he requested within his copyright notice, he retains all rights to the image.
