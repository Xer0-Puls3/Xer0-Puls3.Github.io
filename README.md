# Puls3's Website
All of my things in one place! That's a lot of things!

## Credits
This entire site was written from the ground up starting with nothing but blank files. All of the images, the html, the CSS, the JS, and everything else, was all created from scratch by [Puls3](https://github.com/xPuls3) for this website.

Edit: Recently I've started to use an image that I did not create on my site;
